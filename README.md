# autovit
Add show-hide functionality for selected cars on autovit.ro

## How it works
The script works in Chrome, via TamperMonkey, and adds a small ðŸ™ˆ icon to all the ads (both in the listing page and in the car page).
Clicking that icon "disables" the listing item, keeping it in the browser memory as disabled, until you click it again

## Installation
1. Make sure you have [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) installed in your Chrome browser
2. Install by clicking [here](https://github.com/erosnicolau/autovit/raw/master/autovit.user.js)

## Usage
Once installed, feel free to click the little monkey faces displayed on the listing ads (or individual ad pages), to hide / unhide that ad.
