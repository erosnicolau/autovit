# autovit
Add show-hide functionality for selected cars on autovit.ro

## How it works
The script adds a small ðŸ™ˆ icon to all the ads (both in the listing page and in the car page).
Clicking that icon "disables" the listing item, keeping it in the browser memory as disabled, until you click it again

## Installation
Install by clicking [here](https://github.com/erosnicolau/autovit/raw/master/autovit.user.js)
